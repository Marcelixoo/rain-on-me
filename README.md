# rain-on-me
In a world where small inconveniences destroy potencial great days, avoiding the burden to carry a wet umbrella might bring you some joy.
Leave alone the costs of cleaning up public spaces during and after a rainy day.
"Rain on me" started as an excuse to not carry an umbrella with me and be happy walking in the rain.
After some amazement with the possibilities of improvements in public transport, the idea finally finally took shape: umbrella collectors all over the place equipped with automatic dryers to make them always ready for use without messing up all over the place.

The drying boxes will be managed by a mobile application in order to ensure availability and easy integration with other public transport applications, such as timetables and ticketing system.
Each one will be palced inside buses and trains as well as strategic spots around the city.
Anyone would then be able to drop its wet umbrella and pick up a dry one to continue its commute or walk around the city.

The costs of construction and maintenance were based on commercial hand dryers. They can do the job for an affordable price with a little adaptation and creative work.
The boxes will be able to function automatically, requiring only some source of electricity (1.6 kW) to work properly.
That makes it useful for any public transport companies, as well as highly frequented establishments such as hotels, airports and restaurants.
A convenient way to reducing cleaning costs and offering a more convenient access.
